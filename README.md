## A Pressing Issue 😰

Regular gynecologist visits are crucial to a woman’s health. However, in India, sexual and reproductive health is centered around maternal care.<br/>
_Health Over Stigma_, a survey conducted by the Delhi-based Non Profit Organization Haiyya, revealed that only **1%** of women have received information on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) from their mothers, doctors or government campaigns. It showed that unmarried women are often **denied** services, **misinformed** or **coerced** into decisions.<br/>
**95%** of unmarried women had never visited a gynaecologist to take consultation on sex, pleasure or contraception.<br/>
A study by the Indian Council of Medical Research of 93,356 married women in rural areas showed that only **20.6%** of women knew the availability of services for gynaecological problems.<br/>
Out of the 14.2% women who visited some health facility for their gynaecological problems **only 9.8% felt satisfied with the availed services**. <br/>

Adding to that issue, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, the Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare in India, said that there is a **75% overall shortfall** of gynecologists at Community Health Centres (CHCs) in States and Union Territories.<br/>
