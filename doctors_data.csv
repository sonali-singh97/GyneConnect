I went to her the first time for my HPV Vaccine, and I was a bit hesitant to talk to her, because I wasn't sure about the kind of doctor she'd be. To be perfectly honest, I had a back-up story of how I might be married soon (I have absolutely no intentions of that), just in case she made me too uncomfortable.
Turns out I didn't really need that, she seemed pretty open while talking about being sexually active (She didn't use 'married' as a substitute) and also about ''one-off sexual experiences''. 
I did visit her the second time, and spoke about the emergency pill as well as the birth control course and she was open to prescribing me the latter, as the other doctor in the clinic did, the next month.
I can't say for sure if she's perfectly at ease, but she didn't try to sermonise me and I felt really glad about that. "

He will deal with all variables of culture, background, religion with compassion, understanding, patience and the best medical advice.  His nursing home is always teeming with patients from various backgrounds. 

Joseph Nursing Home at first glance has none of that upscale, maternity hospital glam of let's say a Cloud9. But it has all the latest facilities and adopts the latest practices at a price that will pleasantly surprise you. At least, it surprised me, having shifted from the upmarket Cloud9 from Bangalore. 

Also, I have heard of several instances when Dr Joseph has taken one's financial circumstances into the scheme of things and still afforded them the best care. 

As far as pregnancy is concerned, he is one of those doctors who will attempt a normal delivery provided everything medically supports it. And only choose to do a C-section when it's an absolute must. He's one of the best surgeons around and my C-Section was a breeze, with minimal discomfort post surgery. Joseph Nursing Home is keyed to giving the best care to everyone and in that light you find many from lower middle class and poorer sections of society coming in. So a lot of their procedures, paper work is geared towards them. This might jar to a person from an upper middle class background like me. I took it for granted that the husband would be allowed in for scans. While the husband or any 1 single person is allowed into the delivery room (not applicable to C-Section delivery), the husband or other family members need to seek the Doc's permission to enter the scanning room. This is because they've had instances when the onlooker has insisted on being there in the hope of divining if it's boy or girl from just looking at the screen and tried to coerce the woman to abort. So, this is a preventive measure that I wasn't aware of, but which I initially mistook for prudishness. 

But regardless of whether you're offended by what seems like old-world sensibilities, their procedures are geared towards solely giving the patient the best care. "

When I worried about the pain a speculum would cause me, she suggested on her own that I could insert it myself. THIS WAS HUGE. Because I did it myself, it didn't hurt at all while going in, and there was only a minor flash of pain when she opened it. 
Everyone should insert their own speculums! (and of course, familiarise themselves with their own vaginas enough to feel confidant about inserting stuff into them.)

She was happy to communicate over email and phone when the test results were not great and she told me how to make the next earliest possible appointment.

When we met again, I was with a companion. Not only did she not question the fact that the companion was not a parent or spouse, she went so far as to make sure they were there with my explicit consent. At the end of the conversation, she waited for them to leave and kept me back in the chamber for a minute to ask me a question she thought should be absolutely private. I really, really appreciate this. 

She went through my history properly and looked at my tests, and we discussed options. When she was writing my prescription she made sure she had my explicit consent on the pills she was writing down. She recommended more tests and explained why. She also brought up pregnancy/marriage plans but only in a medical sense. (Ignoring the marriage bit because I'm cutting her some slack considering the context she works in). It would be one course of treatment if I wanted to get pregnant and another if I did not. She brought up childlessness and adoption and affirmed that they were perfectly valid options she would fully respect, but if I did want to get pregnant, she said I was likelier to have fewer problems the earlier I started.

She was not fazed by our 'unmarried' status and asked relevant questions about our sexual activity, accepting the answers without censure. She was a comforting, positive and simultaneously no-nonsense presence both during the procedure and during a subsequent check-up. 
She explained the procedure and the benefits of the hormonal IUD, without pushing us to take it - as we had previously decided on the copper IUD based on internet research. She was respectful of our choice, and her assurance made us rethink our decision and trust her judgement.

The other doctors in the clinic are slightly judgemental and one nurse proceeded to give us a lot of advice about 'settling-down' after taking a look at our files and seeing that we were 'unmarried' and had come in for a procedure that clearly indicated we were sexually active. However she was not overtly offensive, and given her life experience we could see where the lecture came from. She was also unintentionally racist to my friend - though again, in a well-intentioned way.

Do call before you go in and ask specifically if Dr. Alexander will be available and if you can see her, for an unambiguously positive experience.

They will tell u that the doc is available in the evening and when you turn up, they'll always make up some story and ask u to visit the next day in the morning,  but they ask u for payment the previous night!!

However, the gynaecologist told her that she can jolly well have an abortion, but as she is over 30 and she is also married, and without any children (And she does intend to have them), she should have the child, because, as she has a number of cysts in her ovary, her conception is somewhat a miracle, and she should strongly consider having the baby since it is actually for her benefit, since she did want a child. Following her advice, my friend had her baby, and refused to abort even though her husband pressurized her. Ratnaboli Chatterjee guided her through all the steps in pregnancy, told her specifically the dates when she should come for check ups, and gave her telephonic advice for smaller issues, without asking her to come in for a check up.

She did her best to make a natural delivery possible but when the labour did not progress after many many hours of trying, she decided to do a C-sec after asking me if I was okay with it as well. She was very supportive after delivery as well. She ticked off the nurses who were bugging me to give my daughter formula and supported my decision to breastfeed whole-heartedly.
