She did advise weight loss as a general strategy for well-being in an initial consultation, but has not mentioned it or 'needled' me or made me feel like a failure in subsequent follow ups. I found the discussion of the topic sensible - when I asked her for strategy, she advised seeking out a dietician.  \n\nPlease note that she does work within a Christian Missionary hospital and her views on some issues such as abortion may have to do with the place she works in and not her - I don't know as I have not discussed this, but I would advice anyone who is seeking her opinion to be conscious of this.

A lot of doctors who are allegedly open-minded are also quite bad at their jobs. This doctor will eventually try to fleece you and take you to join her private clinic for PCOS but until then she does a good job. She also is knowledgable about diet and about the woman's body. She is matter of fact about STDs and prescribes a single dose of antibiotics for it. She is good, not great but there is so much crap out there that she is much better than any other doctor I've seen. I wouldn't care so much about someone being judgmental as long as they did a good job in terms of medicine and did not over prescribe antibiotics thus ruining your entire health.

She wrote a ton of tests which costed around 13k and then kept insisting I join her Individual package outside the clinic that would be a subscription of 60k for 6 months.

I hadn't had a period in 2+ months, and was freaking out despite negative pregnancy tests. Turns out it was simply a flare-up of PCOS. When I mentioned that I was in a committed long term relationship, she promptly prescribed birth control without batting an eyelid. No judgement or change in behaviour or moral lecturing.

I went to her the first time for my HPV Vaccine, and I was a bit hesitant to talk to her, because I wasn't sure about the kind of doctor she'd be. To be perfectly honest, I had a back-up story of how I might be married soon (I have absolutely no intentions of that), just in case she made me too uncomfortable.\nTurns out I didn't really need that, she seemed pretty open while talking about being sexually active (She didn't use 'married' as a substitute) and also about ''one-off sexual experiences''. \nI did visit her the second time, and spoke about the emergency pill as well as the birth control course and she was open to prescribing me the latter, as the other doctor in the clinic did, the next month.\nI can't say for sure if she's perfectly at ease, but she didn't try to sermonise me and I felt really glad about that.

Call her at any time of the day, literally anytime 24\/7 and be sure your call will be answered and she will also provide you with all the help and support you need at that time and with utmost politeness and patience .  I had been to many doctors before her , but once I was introduced to her I felt it was Gods biggest blessing to have ever known her. And she is one who is always sooooo down to earth and ready to help the lesser fortunate patients with whatever she can do. At no point she will ever send one single negative vibe or thought...

If she sees that they're nervous, she makes sure to do everything she can to make them feel comfortable.

He will deal with all variables of culture, background, religion with compassion, understanding, patience and the best medical advice.  His nursing home is always teeming with patients from various backgrounds. \n\nJoseph Nursing Home at first glance has none of that upscale, maternity hospital glam of let's say a Cloud9. But it has all the latest facilities and adopts the latest practices at a price that will pleasantly surprise you. At least, it surprised me, having shifted from the upmarket Cloud9 from Bangalore. \n\nAlso, I have heard of several instances when Dr Joseph has taken one's financial circumstances into the scheme of things and still afforded them the best care. \n\nAs far as pregnancy is concerned, he is one of those doctors who will attempt a normal delivery provided everything medically supports it. And only choose to do a C-section when it's an absolute must. He's one of the best surgeons around and my C-Section was a breeze, with minimal discomfort post surgery. Joseph Nursing Home is keyed to giving the best care to everyone and in that light you find many from lower middle class and poorer sections of society coming in. So a lot of their procedures, paper work is geared towards them. This might jar to a person from an upper middle class background like me. I took it for granted that the husband would be allowed in for scans. While the husband or any 1 single person is allowed into the delivery room (not applicable to C-Section delivery), the husband or other family members need to seek the Doc's permission to enter the scanning room. This is because they've had instances when the onlooker has insisted on being there in the hope of divining if it's boy or girl from just looking at the screen and tried to coerce the woman to abort. So, this is a preventive measure that I wasn't aware of, but which I initially mistook for prudishness. \n\nBut regardless of whether you're offended by what seems like old-world sensibilities, their procedures are geared towards solely giving the patient the best care.

The problem with that isn't that their unnecessary tests are going to burden the person financially, it is that in such moments of stress and anxiety not knowing what will happen for quite some time only aggravates the suffering and anxiety of the individual.

THIS WAS HUGE. Because I did it myself, it didn't hurt at all while going in, and there was only a minor flash of pain when she opened it. \nEveryone should insert their own speculums! (and of course, familiarise themselves with their own vaginas enough to feel confidant about inserting stuff into them.)\nShe's also been really good about informing me about all my options and then letting me make my own choices about which ART meds and procedures I want to do.\nHer matter-of-fact kindness, even when I sense she's a bit out of her depth at my life choices, has left a very positive residue.","164":"I think she is thoroughly professional with no judgmental tones.

She's extremely courteous and warm while remaining professional. On our first meeting she took down my case history meticulously, and communicated very clearly with me. She listened well and paid attention to all my symptoms, even those that weren't directly related to endometriosis, which is what I'd gone to her for. When it was time for our examination, she sought consent before she touched me. \n\nShe was extremely professional and absolutely non-judgmental about my sexuality, choices, and lifestyle. She recommended a USG at the clinic of an extremely respectful doctor. (Dr Jolly in GK1). She was happy to communicate over email and phone when the test results were not great and she told me how to make the next earliest possible appointment.\n\nWhen we met again, I was with a companion. Not only did she not question the fact that the companion was not a parent or spouse, she went so far as to make sure they were there with my explicit consent. At the end of the conversation, she waited for them to leave and kept me back in the chamber for a minute to ask me a question she thought should be absolutely private. I really, really appreciate this. \n\nShe went through my history properly and looked at my tests, and we discussed options. When she was writing my prescription she made sure she had my explicit consent on the pills she was writing down. She recommended more tests and explained why. She also brought up pregnancy\/marriage plans but only in a medical sense. (Ignoring the marriage bit because I'm cutting her some slack considering the context she works in). It would be one course of treatment if I wanted to get pregnant and another if I did not. She brought up childlessness and adoption and affirmed that they were perfectly valid options she would fully respect, but if I did want to get pregnant, she said I was likelier to have fewer problems the earlier I started. \n\nBasically, she made sure I had all the info. and let me make my own decision. She respects the fact that I don't want to get pregnant and don't see myself wanting to in the future. ","176":null,"177":null,"178":"For once, this doctor is pro-natural delivery.

It was my second visit to the gynaecologist and all I wanted then was information and I must say Dr Rastogi really helped me understand PCOD. She took time to explain in detail (in my case she even drew and gave me a list of dos and dont's) my condition. She told me as much as it was possible to tell someone about PCOD in one sitting. She was non-judgemental and approachable. ","187":"I have had shitty and good experience with gynae on some sensitive topics.

She simply listened to the symptoms, and prescribed medicines and extra tests, without so much as mentioning an examination. When I asked her for one, she asked me if I was \"married, or in a relationship?\" Which made no sense; she just seemed very squeamish about mentioning the term \"sexually (in)active\". I told her, neither. Then she said, \" we don't do any examinations of unmarried girls.\"\n\nShe seemed like a money shark. Prescribed more tests, refused an examination, and just to make sure I got those tests done from her clinic, made one of the attendants \"guide\" me to the lab upstairs.\n\nI'm cis-heterosexual, but I highly doubt she would be accepting of LGBT persons\/orientations.\n\nWhen I started asking questions, she rang the bell. \nI tried asking about cervical cancer vaccinations, but the doctor was not up to date on the options available. She cut me off and asked her attendant to take me to the lab. \nThe vaccination costs at her clinic are also more than at Max and AIIMS. \nAll in all, a very fishy experience.","191":null,"192":"He can be trusted blindly because he is ethical and not in the scheme of making money through C secs etc ","193":"Extremely honest doctor who doesn't rush to prescribe unnecessary checks, tests, treatment or interventions.

She answered all questions I had comprehensively. I took my boyfriend with me the first time we went to see her. She was respectful and friendly.

Dr. Sikka made her feel very comfortable during the consultation, and I was impressed enough to go back to her myself and also recommended her to family members. From what I've experienced, her concern is solely regarding her patient's medical health -regarding pregnancy or contraception, she is not interested in your marital status and will not make you feel judged. \nWhen I was diagnosed with PCOD, I decided to try alternative therapy- homeopathy- and while Dr. Sikka preferred the line of biomedical treatment she suggested, she was open to me following homeopathic treatment, so that I could work with both doctors together. Dr. Sikka prescribed tests and ultrasounds and interpreted them regularly, and I took her feedback to my homeopath and eventually, I was PCOD free. I appreciated her openness to this. \nI have also once sent to Dr. Sikka a domestic staff person who worked in our home- this woman's young daughter was sexually molested and she wanted to make sure her daughter was infection-free. Dr. Sikka did not charge her for the consultation, even though I had sent the money for her fees. \nAt the time I started going to her, she charged Rs 300 when other doctors in private hospitals in South Delhi were not charging less than Rs 500.

She could've easily asked me to get unnecessary tests done and come back to her, which is what most doctors do to make extra bucks. But she did no such thing. The doctor is extremely polite, non-judgemental and open to answering questions. The only problem is that the waiting times can cause quite a headache, since I've had to wait for over an hour, even with a confirmed appointment.","234":"I had a horrible experience with this doctor. At first he did not want to hear my medical history, only my symptoms. While my symptoms were only relevant while placed in my history, as my periods were severely out of sync. After explaining my history to him he went on and on about how my endometriosis was treated wrongly before, that there was no need for an endometriosis patient to take hormones. What is endometriosis after all? It is just an abnormality to the body, just like the fact that he was bald was an abnormality to his body. At that point I got furious: how dare he as a doctor compare being bald with my disease, which has caused me so much physical pain that at one point I even dropped out of college, which will probably result in me having difficulties with conceiving. Yes, that is totally the same as being bald! ","235":"I was terrified when I went and she was a big help. She was accessible by phone if I had any questions in the following days.

She's the best doctor I could've hoped for under the circumstances.","236":null,"237":"I decided to visit her after reading the testimonials on this spreadsheet.

She carefully walked through our sexual and health history (we are an unmarried couple); and discussed different methods of birth control and their side effects, and prescribed us a regular oral contraceptive pill based on our discussion. We left completely satisfied, and it wasn't awkward at all. ","239":"I went to her for the first time at age 21 with a UTI, embarrassed and awkward, and she put me at ease immediately. She didn't judge me for being sexually active and prescribed minimal medication, and I felt better almost immediately. At that time, what I needed most was a doctor I could ask questions to frankly, and not worry that they would want to speak to my parents. I had been hearing stories from my friends at the time of gynecologists who would only entertain them if their mother was with them, or worse, would call their mothers and relay everything the minute they were out of the office. \n\nPoonam Singh was straightforward, understanding and non-judgmental and though I have not gone to her in recent times, as I preferred to find a gynecologist located closer to me, I have recommended her to various friends who have all been thrilled with her. She is unfazed by awkward questions and answers them patiently and reassuringly. I recommend her highly.","240":"I have had absolutely horrid experiences of visiting mutiple gynaecologists in Delhi around 2 years ago when I had cysts in my vagina. I had visited 5 gynaecologists till I found Dr Geeta Chadha and Dr Raka Guleria. I expected to be morally judged by them as well but to my relief and surprise they were very easy to talk to and did not express any shock in finding out that I was unmarried and sexually active.

The woman in the ultrasound room was quite surprised at being asked to vaginally give me an ultrasound though I was not married. \n\nAdditionally, I was not happy with the requirement at the hospital to fill in husband's or father's name. It seemed unnecessary. ","260":"Dr. Alexander was very respectful and non-judgemental when a friend and I went to her to ask about IUDs and subsequently had them inserted. She was not fazed by our 'unmarried' status and asked relevant questions about our sexual activity, accepting the answers without censure. She was a comforting, positive and simultaneously no-nonsense presence both during the procedure and during a subsequent check-up. \nShe explained the procedure and the benefits of the hormonal IUD, without pushing us to take it - as we had previously decided on the copper IUD based on internet research. She was respectful of our choice, and her assurance made us rethink our decision and trust her judgement.\n\nThe other doctors in the clinic are slightly judgemental and one nurse proceeded to give us a lot of advice about 'settling-down' after taking a look at our files and seeing that we were 'unmarried' and had come in for a procedure that clearly indicated we were sexually active. However she was not overtly offensive, and given her life experience we could see where the lecture came from. She was also unintentionally racist to my friend - though again, in a well-intentioned way.\n\nDo call before you go in and ask specifically if Dr. Alexander will be available and if you can see her, for an unambiguously positive experience.

Had a very difficult pregnancy - and this doc came into my life only in my 8th month - but she was great pre and post delivery. My lil one was quite unwell after birth and the doc stood with me throughout the time I made rounds of the NICU and till the time my baby was healthy and discharged from the hospital - a good one month. ","309":"She spoke very kindly to me, offered me tea during the consultation and asked what my boyfriend was like, how we met etc. She calmed me down a lot. It was like talking to a friend. And really really helpful after a very unhappy first visit with another (young but) judgemental gynaec.

She keeps busy- might need to call her a couple of times to look at your report","313":null,"314":null,"315":"Dr. Duru made me feel very comfortable about everything related to my appointment. The only downside was the wait time as they were not very punctual, but I would wait hours for a good doctor, rather than be seen by a punctual doctor who judges me and makes me feel uncomfortable.","316":null,"317":"She's awesome! Have recommended her to many a friend!","318":"Dr Jyoti Mehta is an old school gynecologist. She and her husband who is a pediatrician and practice from the same clinic do it more as a service than as a profession. Dr. Jyoti Mehta does not advice unnecessary surgical or other intrusive procedures unless absolutely necessary. On the other hand she also makes use of all the modern day diagnostic tools available to decide what level of external medical procedures are required.","319":null,"320":null,"321":null,"322":"She's really positive about contraceptive pills and other devices, irrespective of marital status. She is positive about sexual activity in unmarried people, though I can't speak to queer or disabled experiences. ","323":"She is a very nice person, very helpful, and approachable. Have been very comfortable interacting with her.","324":null,"325":"She's quite chatty, but she's open-minded and I find her to be a good, practical, fastidious person.","326":"She's an extremely considerate, non-judgmental gynecologist.

I was diagnosed with a growth reduction baby and Dr. Padma and the pediatrician Dr. Meena guided me through this stressful time with patience, love, and care  and the correct sort of guidance that was so useful!","329":"She has been an excellent doctor to me and to some of my friends who recommended her. She's easily accessible, non-judgmental, thorough and most significantly, kind and understanding.","330":null,"331":"He is an excellent doctor but is money minded. You will.likely have to pay him additional money(other than the actual procedure) to maintain your privacy.\nHe respects the patients privacy, but you will be required to get the tests like ultrasound and blood tests done under a false name if you wish to protect your identity as he out sources them.\n","332":"He was extremely professional - the best surgeon in the industry. I felt very safe in his hands. The hospital was remarkable - very warm staff across the tiers. They ensured minimal pain. They treated us like family. I was amazed. They are my first choice of telemedicine even if I live in Delhi. They did not overcharge - no matter what surgery was done. They provided meals for my family included in the package.

But I would presume if you are preggers it will go faster!","336":"I liked the fact that she asked if I had a regular 'partner' instead of boyfriend","337":"She was extremely non-judgemental about my sexual history and was very supportive about taking some tests. She even suggested measures I could take to avoid future problems. ","338":"I have had a good experience with him. I started consulting him before my marriage, especially with regards to birth control options. At no point, did he ask for my parents, would-be husband's consent. I had made it clear that I did not plan to have kids so wanted a long-term contraception and he had suggested the IUD. My husband came along only the day I got the IUD inserted. subsequently, when me and my husband separated, I went to see the doctor again and he advised removal of IUD and using OC pills if I was having an active sexual life. At no point, did I feel he was being judgemental or righteous. ","339":"We went primarily because my partner had some concerns and questions about me taking a hormonal form of birth control, and any potential side effects. She was very understanding and did not brush anything aside, explained multiple possibilities and options in a very direct, open and honest way. She was careful when talking about her personal opinion, and mentioned so, but kept things as professional as possible, and talked the way I expect a medical professional. We left feeling comfortable, knowledgeable about our options and with a sense of ease of access to her.","340":null,"341":"Dr Shantala is an absolute delight to interact with. She always answers all questions patiently and makes you feel very comfortable. She is not intimidating at all.\n\nWe had a long conversation about pain medication during labour. My mother didn't want me to go in for any medication, while I said I definitely want whatever is available, because I have a low threshold for pain. Dr Shantala took my side (in a diplomatic manner) and explained that different people feel different levels of pain and in the end she would do whatever I asked for.\n\nI got my epidural when I asked for it. We tried for a normal delivery as per plan, but I developed some complications (contractions stopped completely, cervix began closing up, baby's heart beat dropped), so I had to be rushed for an emergency c section. \n\nIn case you have any doubts between appointments, you can email her and she always replies.","342":null,"343":"She is extremely liberal in her thinking, was open to discussing birth control for single women, and discussed the use of menstrual cups and tampons with ease, even recommending them. ","344":"Dr. Shiraz is a very patient, kind and knowledgeable gynaec. Going to her even the first time wasn't embarrassing and she puts you at ease when she's checking you. She immediately also addresses any other issues she may discover, too and overall puts you at ease. ","345":"Dr Shiraz is one of the nicest and most compassionate doctors I've met. After a traumatic and regrettable experience at Kokilaben Hospital, meeting her changed my negative perception of doctors completely.","346":null,"347":null,"348":null,"349":null,"350":"I had struggled to find a good gynae. The last one being in Delhi, who had underlined the words 'unmarried' next to sexually active.\n\nThen I came to Mumbai and contacted Dr. Suchita (deets below) for a UTI.\nShe was patient, completely non judgmental and instantly put me at ease.","351":null,"352":"this is the best gynac i have found in Mumbai especially after searching for many many doctors. She is non judgemental, caring and sometimes unfraid to play devils advocate. She is reliable and very helpful. She allows for you to cater to your chosen lifestyle but will warn you gently if you are puytting your health in jeopardy. She was very open and careful with me whn I mentioned my history of anorexia. the first and only doctor not to attribute my worries merely to weight gain ","353":"She's a fantastic doctor. Kind well informed assertive ","354":"I learned through my experience with my illness how little women know about their bodies...I didn't. Then I wanted to but didn't find people who would help, but scientific books helped. I don't think one can trust any professional blindly. Also for sexual concerns which are closely related to body issues or other psychological concerns, need intervention from a therapist and a gynae might not be able to help. They ain't God! ","355":"She's a great doctor, but unlike most of the great doctors I have met, she's an absolute pleasure. She didn't judge me for my history, prescribed contraceptive pills immediately so I would be safe, examined me thoroughly and with respect, taught me how to do self breast exams and what tests to do regularly to screen. Finding her was a very important step in my journey towards healing and finding my strength and voice.  \n","356":null,"357":null,"358":"She's very busy, so it translates into being businesslike and brusque. But she deals with tons of working class patients and elite patients and treats them both alike! The faith her patients have in her is amazing and very palpable. I found her totally non-judgemental and matter-of-fact when I had my abortion 19 years ago. She doesn't overmedicate or suggest any invasive procedure unless absolutely necessary but is quick to take decisions and act without delay esp when i started bleeding after menopause. I think it helps that she is part of the bunch of doctors who were also part of a movement by doctors in the 80s and 90s who actively talked and discussed and debated rational health practices and pro-people medicine.","359":null,"360":"She has been of excellent when i needed her. She has also been available on a phone call. I was extremely comfortable with her.. she never was judgmental or probing  ","361":"Had visited her for pregnancy and my experience was great. ","362":"She's experienced and communicates beautifully with patients. I particularly like how I was able to discuss multiple treatment options with her. In matters pertaining to hormonal problems, I appreciate that she advocated change in diet and exercise persistently and only prescribed medication where absolutely essential.","363":"I went to her because I counldn't find a gynac in town who wouldn't give me shit about my weight and lecture me to get married and have babies.  I also was uncomfortable going to a male doctor.   I am sexually active and had a lot of questions related to contraception, etc.  Some of the questions she got a bit squeamish about but still answered them.  She was very open and accepting about abortion - said she could help with unwanted preganancies but was afraid about STD's so warned me to be careful.  She was also open to discussing children without being married. ","364":"Dr Bhatija is brusque in a manner that can often pass off as rude. It suits me to have a gynaec who doesn't link everything back to my feelings or morals, but simply treats me as a patient.She's quick, matter of fact and incredibly non-judgemental. She did once tell me that its okay not to use contraceptives on certain days and I almost ran from the room, but other than that she's given me pretty sound advice and great treatment for UTIs","365":"This has been my third gynac and I finally feel comfortable. It's also the quickest, most fuss-free pap smear I've ever had! Highly recommended.

He not only diagnosed me when 16 previous specialists couldn't, he ensured that the surgery required and post-op care was impeccable. He took the time to understand my desires and requirements, in terms of my lifestyle, my decisions regarding procreation, my sex life, everything. And not once was he judgmental. I know several women who will agree with me. He never once questions a woman's right to request birth control (in any form). In fact, he will ensure that he studies the patient's requirements and charts properly to make sure she gets the best form suited to her physiology and needs. He has the best bedside manner I have ever seen in a doctor, and made sure that I was not only calm before my surgery, but actually looking forward to it!","372":"She has comforted me without judgement multiple times and has placed my health and choice above all else.

Seems really old but best doctor I've been to so far.","374":null,"375":"I have endometriosis and Dr. Pranay is the one diagnosed me. I have been visiting him ever since I was 21. After changing about 7 gynaes, he was a breath of fresh air. He put my needs before what my parents thought was right and he calmly explained it to them. He always entertains all your questions. Does not prescribe any unnecessary medication. He has done my last 2 surgeries and there were no complications. He respects my life choices and does not judge me for being sexually active before marriage and he has never suggested marriage as an alternative in any context. He respects my privacy and has not disclosed certain aspects of my lifestyle to my parents.

","380":null,"381":null,"382":"I visited the doctor since I was worried about my late period because I was sexually active. She was more nonjudgmental of me than I was of myself. She explained how all women have the scare I'm experiencing. She was very soft spoken and understanding.","383":"Dr Shah discusses sexual experiences and health with zero emphasis on one's marital status. Sex and all that comes with it is for her a topic of clinical, not moral discussion. Yet the conversations, should you feel the need for an extensive one, are anything but cold and clinical - along with information and guidance, Dr Shah strikes a balance with her easy empathy. ","384":null,"385":"My friends and I have all had a great experience with Dr. Dhrupti, she's very open and we're all sexually active women. She definitely keeps your privacy, she's my friend's mother's close friend and yet my friend feels comfortable enough to share her sexual history. She has been very forthcoming on all the contraceptive methods without judging your background. Especially in the case of abortion she made us feel very comfortable, no questions asked.","386":"She is very to the point, professional and has been non-judgmental irrespective of my age and history.

I had had unprotected sex after a long gap of abstinence, taken an iPill and was having a slightly alarming bout of spotting. I went to her highly anxious and fully expecting to be judged. She was friendly, completely non-judgemental and extremely considerate as well as gentle while examining me. She made me completely at ease, an experience I hadn't had before, because of which I have been recommending her to all my friends since.","396":null,"397":"She is a friendly person and answers all questions by drawings, models to understand any specific queries related to one's condition.

This was before I was married. She was extremely professional. I never felt judged by her or her team. I appreciated that. I would have liked more information in the form of an explanation of the procedure. I have found though, that she is not very forthright with information. You have to ask her questions if you want to find out what's wrong with you (happened with me when I visited her later with other problems). ","417":"Dr.Gandikota was most respectful and supportive of my choice to not have children. There was no judgment and no censure in her tone or behaviour. She also advised against certain birth control based on my own health issues and recommended that the onus of birth control be on me and my partner jointly. She is a gentle and kind person and has always made me feel comfortable. ","418":"I went to Dr Gadhikar for my first (and only) pregnancy. I initially thought she was too brusque but I began to appreciate this no-nonsense way of interaction from her side. She was always available over the phone and once opened her clinic early morning when I developed sudden back pain during the last leg of my pregnancy. She's a very careful doctor who does not take any chances. I went into labour on a Sunday but she still came to check on me after I'd been admitted in the hospital though I was in 'pre-labour' and nowhere close to delivery. She did her best to make a natural delivery possible but when the labour did not progress after many many hours of trying, she decided to do a C-sec after asking me if I was okay with it as well. She was very supportive after delivery as well. She ticked off the nurses who were bugging me to give my daughter formula and supported my decision to breastfeed whole-heartedly. She taught me how to do it as well. \n\nI'm immensely grateful to Dr.Gadhikar and I still can't talk about her without feeling a little sappy!

She was reviewed by a woman who wanted to have a baby and had a 'good' experience. But I found her to be like the usual Indian gynaec, non-judgemental to some extent, but commercial all the same. I had to go through some expensive tests prescribed to labs she knew and then asked to get pregnant asap even though we wanted to discuss options for being child free. ","424":null,"425":null,"426":"I don't know","427":"I had a very good experience during my pregnancy. Dr. Richa Agarwal is just amazing. She answers all my question and explains every thing by drawing the diagram and she makes sure that all my doubts are cleared. On the D-day she gave me and my family courage and strength and because of her I had a normal delivery. She is not at all money minded because even if I consult her on phone she use to guide me properly.

I am grateful to have found the right doc in Udaipur in my first attempt. I think what also helped me and her was that I called in advance to discuss why I wanted to see her and explicitly asked if she is an open minded doctor, explaining that I'd had several very hurtful experiences in the past and was looking to avoid a repeat. I think she recognised me when I entered her clinic and having been assured by her earlier that she wasn't going to judge me, I could speak freely without being defensive (which is what I've reflex-ed into after painful experiences with other doctors). ","439":null,"440":"She's famous for supporting normal deliveries in the world of unnecessary C-sections. However, she supports unnecerssary interventions like inducing labor, episiotomy, etc. I had a very happy delivery and she has respected me well during the entire labor experience but that may be because of our personal relationship as well.","441":"Very calm and compassionate person.

I find her to be gentle and kind, with a talent for putting her patients at ease.","448":"I went to Dr Jetter as I wanted to receive an IUD. I was 21 then and nervous about the procedure itself, along with the fact that I hadn't told my family. She let me play music as I told her that would help me feel more relaxed. During the procedure, she was extremely caring and understanding of the pain I felt throughout the procedure. She continued to seek consent as the procedure progressed, and let me know several times that at any point of time I could ask her to stop. She walked me through the entire procedure as it happened. She assuaged my fears and nervousness about getting the IUD. She was professional throughout the procedure. After the procedure was complete, she made sure that I was feeling okay to be able to go back home and didn't rush me. She was non-judgemental and did not question or remark on any of my personal decisions of getting an IUD or being sexually active. She encouraged safe sex. ","449":"I highly recommend this Gynae for anyone in Geneva or surrounding neighbourhoods. She is warm, multi-lingual and extremely friendly. I highly doubt that I will ever find a gynaecologist as non-judgemental and well-informed as her (especially in India). I've had the most reassuring and friendly conversations with her on topics ranging from sexual activity with one\/multiple partners, contraception\/protection, lubricants, women's libido and so on. While doing an ultrasound, she even takes time to explain what's where inside the uterus, any occurring changes etc."}}
