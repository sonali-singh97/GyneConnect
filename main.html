                <!-- Need for finding trustworthy gynaecs in India... -->
                In India, sexual and reproductive health is centered around maternal care. In fact, the only time when most women have 
                ever visited a gynecologist is when they are pregnant. Unmarried women are even more judged and shamed for their 
                sexuality. A survey <a href="http://www.haiyya.in/our-works/health-over-stigma/">Health Over Stigma</a> conducted by the
                Delhi-based Non Profit Organization <a href="http://www.haiyya.in">Haiyya</a> revealed that only 1% of women have received 
                information on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) from their mothers, doctors or government campaigns.
                It showed that unmarried women are often denied services, misinformed or coerced into decisions. 95% of unmarried women had never
                visited a gynaecologist to take consultation on sex, pleasure or contraception.
                The stigma around reproductive and sexual health and well being only worsens in rural areas. A study by the 
                <a href="https://www.ijcm.org.in/article.asp?issn=0970-0218;year=2003;volume=28;issue=2;spage=67;epage=67;aulast=kambo;type=0">Indian Council of Medical Research</a>
                of 93,356 married women in rural areas showed that only 20.6% of women knew the availability of services for gynaecological
                problems. Out of the 14.2% women who visited some health facility for their gynaecological problems only 9.8% 
                felt satisfied with the availed services.
                In India, unsafe abortions account for about <a href = "In India, unsafe abortions account for about 3,500 women dying every year. Abortion complications are the third major cause of maternal death, after haemorrhage and sepsis.">3,500</a> women dying every year. Abortion complications are the <a href=In India, unsafe abortions account for about 3,500 women dying every year. Abortion complications are the third major cause of maternal death, after haemorrhage and sepsis.>third major 
                    cause</a> of maternal death, after haemorrhage and sepsis.
                And it goes without saying that the case is even <a href = "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/problems-with-lgbtq-healthcare-access/article25284497.ece">worse</a> for members of the LGBTQ community. 
                As studied by the <a href="https://data.unaids.org/publications/irc-pub02/jc587-india_en.pdf">UNAID</a>, there is also a staggering amount of Discrimination, Stigmatization
                and Denial of health services to HIV/AIDS patients.
