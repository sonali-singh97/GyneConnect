                In India, sexual and reproductive health is centered around maternal care. In fact, the only time when most women have 
                ever visited a gynecologist is when they are pregnant. Unmarried women are even more judged and shamed for their 
                sexuality. <br/> A survey <a href="http://www.haiyya.in/our-works/health-over-stigma/">Health Over Stigma</a> conducted by the
                Delhi-based Non Profit Organization <a href="http://www.haiyya.in">Haiyya</a> revealed that only <b>1%</b> of women have received 
                information on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) from their mothers, doctors or government campaigns.
                It showed that unmarried women are often denied services, misinformed or coerced into decisions. <b>95%</b> of unmarried women had never
                visited a gynecologist to take consultation on sex, pleasure or contraception.<br/>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                <br/>The stigma around reproductive and sexual health and well being only worsens in rural areas. A study by the 
                <a href="https://www.ijcm.org.in/article.asp?issn=0970-0218;year=2003;volume=28;issue=2;spage=67;epage=67;aulast=kambo;type=0">Indian Council of Medical Research</a>
                of <b>93,356</b> married women in rural areas showed that only <b>20.6%</b> of women knew the availability of services for gynecological
                problems. Out of the <b>14.2%</b> women who visited some health facility for their gynecological problems only <b>9.8%</b> 
                felt satisfied with the availed services. <br/>
                In India, unsafe abortions account for about <b>3,500</b> women dying every year. Abortion complications are the <b>third</b> major 
                cause of maternal death, after haemorrhage and sepsis.
                And it goes without saying that the case is even <a href = "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/problems-with-lgbtq-healthcare-access/article25284497.ece">worse</a> for members of the LGBTQ community. 
                As studied by the <a href="https://data.unaids.org/publications/irc-pub02/jc587-india_en.pdf">UNAID</a>, there is also a staggering amount of Discrimination, Stigmatization
                and Denial of health services to HIV/AIDS patients.
                <br><br>
                This is our attempt to help women from all parts of the country connect with <b>trustworthy, respectful, well-trained</b> 
                gynecologists and get access to quality sexual and reproductive healthcare without any judgement.
